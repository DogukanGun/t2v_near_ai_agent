Mythos is a next-generation AI Agent Agency designed for early-stage blockchain projects, marketers, and Web3 startups.
Built on NEAR Protocol, Mythos leverages NEAR AI and NEAR Intents to deliver autonomous, on-chain AI agents that automate marketing, content creation, and engagement.

🚀 Overview
Mythos enables blockchain projects to outsource growth tasks to AI agents that operate on-chain, coordinate with other agents, and execute intent-driven actions without intermediaries.

Core features:

Twitter Reply Agent – Engages in real-time conversations, builds audience reach, and automates brand replies for Web3 startups.

Video Agent – Creates short-form content (TikTok, YouTube Shorts) powered by AI-generated scripts, captions, and optimization tools.

NEAR Intents Integration – Ensures seamless, trustless, AI-native transactions for automated task execution and payments.

Multi-Agent System – Scales with additional agents for marketing automation, analytics, and cross-platform campaigns.

🧠 Powered by NEAR AI
Mythos uses NEAR AI to deploy autonomous AI agents that:

Orchestrate tasks across social media platforms.

Analyze engagement data on-chain for verifiable insights.

Coordinate with other agents (e.g., Reply Agent ↔ Video Agent) for optimized content workflows.

Self-execute actions via NEAR Intents with no centralized approvals.

⚡ NEAR Intents Integration
NEAR Intents is the AI-native transaction layer that allows Mythos agents to:

Trigger blockchain actions (tweets, content posting, payments) on behalf of users.

Handle microtransactions for per-task execution costs.

Ensure trustless, automated execution of marketing campaigns.

Provide transparent, auditable, and on-chain agent activity logs.

🎥 Video Agent
The Video Agent is designed for high-performance content production:

Generates scripts, captions, and titles from trending topics.

Produces short-form videos for TikTok and YouTube Shorts.

Works alongside the Twitter Agent to repurpose viral threads into videos.

Uses NEAR AI for orchestration and NEAR Intents for on-chain execution and task tracking.

🛠 Architecture
User Intent → On-chain request (e.g., “create 5 reply tweets about DeFi project X”).

NEAR Intents Layer → Executes AI-native transaction, triggers agent actions.

NEAR AI Agent → Processes the request, coordinates multiple AI agents.

Output → Replies, videos, analytics results returned on-chain with transparent proof-of-execution.

## üöÄ Overview

Mythos enables blockchain projects to outsource growth tasks to AI agents that operate on-chain, coordinate with other agents, and execute intent-driven actions without intermediaries.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Twitter Reply Agent** ‚Äì Engages in real-time conversations, builds audience reach, and automates brand replies for Web3 startups
- **Video Agent** ‚Äì Creates short-form content (TikTok, YouTube Shorts) powered by AI-generated scripts, captions, and optimization tools
- **NEAR Intents Integration** ‚Äì Ensures seamless, trustless, AI-native transactions for automated task execution and payments
- **Multi-Agent System** ‚Äì Scales with additional agents for marketing automation, analytics, and cross-platform campaigns

## üõ† Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Required Software

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher) - [Download](https://python.org/)
- **npm** or **yarn** - Package manager for Node.js
- **pip** - Python package manager (usually comes with Python)

### Optional but Recommended

- **Docker** - For containerized deployment
- **Git** - Version control system
- **VS Code** - Recommended IDE with Python and TypeScript extensions

### Environment Setup

You'll need to create environment files for both backend and frontend:

- Backend: `.env` file in the `backend/` directory
- Frontend: Environment variables (if needed) in the `app/` directory

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DogukanGun/t2v_near_ai_agent.git
cd t2v_near_ai_agent
```

2. Set up the backend (FastAPI):
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

3. Set up the frontend (Next.js) in a new terminal:
```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üñ•Ô∏è Backend Setup

The backend is built with FastAPI and provides REST API endpoints for the AI agents.

### Step 1: Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv mythos-env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
mythos-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source mythos-env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # If example exists
# Or create manually:
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
```env
# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mythos
CONNECTION_STRING=your_connection_string

# Authentication
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
ALGORITHM=HS256
OTP_SECRET=your_otp_secret

# Email (if using email features)
EMAIL=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

# Environment
OS=dev
```

### Step 5: Run the Backend Server
```bash
# Development mode
python main.py

# Or using uvicorn directly
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The backend will be available at:
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Interactive API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Alternative API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

### Backend Testing
Test if the backend is running correctly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","message":"Service is up and running"}
```

## üåê Frontend Setup

The frontend is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and DaisyUI for a modern, responsive interface.

### Step 1: Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Or using yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration (if needed)
Create environment files if your application requires them:
```bash
# For local development
touch .env.local

# Add any required environment variables
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000" >> .env.local
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server
```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Or using yarn
yarn dev

# Or using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Or using bun
bun dev
```

### Step 5: Build for Production (Optional)
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

The frontend will be available at:
- Development: http://localhost:3000
- Production: http://localhost:3000 (after build and start)

### Frontend Development

- Main application page: `app/page.tsx`
- Layout configuration: `app/layout.tsx`
- Components: `app/components/`
- Documentation page: `app/docs/page.tsx`

The page auto-updates as you edit files thanks to Next.js hot reload.

### Customization

The project uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **DaisyUI** for component library
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Geist Font** for typography (automatically optimized)

You can customize the theme in `tailwind.config.js` and modify DaisyUI themes as needed.

## üß† Powered by NEAR AI

Mythos uses NEAR AI to deploy autonomous AI agents that:

- **Orchestrate tasks** across social media platforms
- **Analyze engagement data** on-chain for verifiable insights
- **Coordinate with other agents** (e.g., Reply Agent ‚Üî Video Agent) for optimized content workflows
- **Self-execute actions** via NEAR Intents with no centralized approvals

## ‚ö° NEAR Intents Integration

NEAR Intents is the AI-native transaction layer that allows Mythos agents to:

- **Trigger blockchain actions** (tweets, content posting, payments) on behalf of users
- **Handle microtransactions** for per-task execution costs
- **Ensure trustless, automated execution** of marketing campaigns
- **Provide transparent, auditable**, and on-chain agent activity logs

## üé• Video Agent

The Video Agent is designed for high-performance content production:

- **Generates scripts, captions, and titles** from trending topics
- **Produces short-form videos** for TikTok and YouTube Shorts
- **Works alongside the Twitter Agent** to repurpose viral threads into videos
- **Uses NEAR AI** for orchestration and NEAR Intents for on-chain execution and task tracking

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
User Intent ‚Üí On-chain request (e.g., ‚Äúcreate 5 reply tweets about DeFi project X‚Äù).

NEAR Intents Layer ‚Üí Executes AI-native transaction, triggers agent actions.

NEAR AI Agent ‚Üí Processes the request, coordinates multiple AI agents.

Output ‚Üí Replies, videos, analytics results returned on-chain with transparent proof-of-execution.

## üìÖ Roadmap

### 2025 Development Timeline

- **Q1**: NEAR AI integration, Twitter Reply Agent MVP, Video Agent alpha release
- **Q2**: Beta release with multi-agent orchestration and first user onboarding
- **Q3**: Expanded video and social campaign automation with analytics dashboard
- **Q4**: Open Agent Marketplace for third-party AI marketing agents
